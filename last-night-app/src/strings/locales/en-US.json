I find your prying inquiries rather uncouth, an invasive affront to my personal endeavors. But if you must be satiated, then know this: I have, through means I shall not disclose, clandestinely obtained the remote, granting me absolute dominion over the projector.",
    "message.tim.19.t.3": "Oh cool, can you control it from here?",
    "message.tim.19.t.4": "Please, don’t insult me with such a trivial question. Of course I can. Even among this rabble I wouldn’t be so mind-numbingly foolish as to position myself beyond its reach, and lose my uncontestable leverage.",

    "message.tim.20.t.1": "You know I think it would be really funny if you turned the projector on. Just to mess with the principal.",
    "message.tim.20.t.2": "You wish for me to wield this power for mere amusement? To sow discord and revel in the ensuing chaos? Well, I must admit that is an absolutely brilliant proposition. And so, on this day, you and I forge an unholy alliance. Partners in crime.",

    "message.tim.21.t.2": "I certainly do not, and even if I did, I would sooner craft my own with my own two hands. After all, why would I settle for anything less when I possess the skill to create something far superior than some store bought scraps? I am, as it happens, a rather exceptional baker.",
