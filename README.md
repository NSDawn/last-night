# What's the Tea, Sis?

A game made for the Girly Game Jam, hosted by Makritza.

## Pitch

Your name is Angela McHawtÃ©. The hottest girl in school. This prom night was going to be special -- someone was going to confess their HUGE crush on you. 

Just one thing. 

You ate something bad, and you've got hot girl IBS âœ¨ðŸš½. 

You've gotta send your nerdy twin sister, Kaytlyn, in your place. Through obsessively texting your sister and your friends, can you secure the deets before its too late?
